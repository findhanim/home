description: "Beige is a collaborative work between myself and Jovil, a Tumblr theme developer. I was proposed to work on the interface design for both desktop and mobile previews for this project. We settled on a minimal theme to gives off a youthful and modern look, since the platform is commonly used by the millennials and gen Z's.
